Under our Senior Content Marketing Manager, you will own the content for MemberClicks as a part of our Small-Medium Business (SMB) unit.</p>\n<p>SEO is a crucial driver for our segment, and you're going to be instrumental in making MemberClicks an industry-leading brand publisher in our space. You will work across the marketing funnel, write to the needs of our audience (Nonprofits, trade associations, Chambers of Commerce, etc.), and have a direct impact on business results. You will blend your fine-tuned analytical skills with your creative mind by developing content that appeals to Google's algorithm, supports the buying journey, and helps our audience increase the impact of their mission-driven organizations.</p>\n<p>Who you are</p>\n<p>You're a wordsmith by trade and are always looking for ways to improve your writing, editorial, and proofreading (hey, grammar nerds!) skills. But you go beyond being a Creative: you bring an understanding of B2B strategy, full-funnel marketing, and content optimization. You care about how your content impacts business results and are motivated to take ownership of reporting on what is or isn't working.</p>\n<p>If you've been involved in the nonprofit sector as a volunteer, staff member, marketer, board member, or otherwise, make sure you highlight this experience: already understanding our audience could give you a leg up in the application process!</p>\n<p>What's in it for you</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Influence and balance.

You will work with our Senior Content Marketing Manager and our SEO Consultant to create content within a portfolio SEO strategy that promotes MemberClicks to our target prospects\u2014without cannibalizing the target markets of Personify's other brands. You will gain and apply new insights and approaches to optimizing content.</li>\n<li>Apply full-funnel thinking to the content you create. You will build out your understanding of how thought leadership and nurture content come together to position our solutions as the answer to target markets' pain points.

Families spend up to $500 a month to stay connected to their loved ones inside. A 15-minute phone call runs as steep as $25. Our work has never been more important.
