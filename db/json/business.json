When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. when reopens in Fall 2021. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada* and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><strong>Engaging Workday:</strong> The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this \u2018sync time\u2019 is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><strong>Work-Rest Balance: </strong>The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is natural part of the workday.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><strong>Social Connection: </strong>Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We're also building local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City in Fall 2021.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Perks at Loom</strong></div>\n<div>Competitive compensation and equity package</div>\n<div>99% company paid medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and dependents (for US employees)</div>\n<div>Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA)</div>\n<div>Healthcare reimbursement (for International employees)</div>\n<div>Life, AD&amp;D, Short and Long Term Disability Insurance</div>\n<div>401(k) with 4% company matching</div>\n<div>Professional development reimbursement</div>\n<div>Mental health and wellness reimbursement</div>\n<div>Gym reimbursement</div>\n<div>Unlimited PTO</div>\n<div>Paid parental leave</div>\n<div>Remote work opportunities</div>\n<div>Home office &amp; technology reimbursement</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><strong style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Loom = Equal Opportunity Employer</strong></div>\n<div>We are actively seeking to create a diverse work environment because teams are stronger with different perspectives and experiences.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>We value a diverse workplace and encourage women, people of color, LGBTQIA individuals, people with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, foreign-born residents, older members of society, and others from minority groups and diverse backgrounds to apply.

With fewer than ten employees, he created eMBRY Health to fill the testing void. <br><br>Over the last year, our company has experienced rapid growth due to the pressing need for COVID-19 testing services. Nearly 300,000 Arizonans have benefited from eMBRY Health's critical testing services, and we've wanted to offer such services nationwide. In just the last few weeks, eMBRY Health has expanded its national footprint and established testing sites in states such as Florida, Hawaii, Colorado, and Texas. Nearly 10,000 people get tested by visiting eMBRY Health testing sites daily in all markets.  <br><br>In the next year, eMBRY Health envisions being fully operational with COVID-19 testing services in all 50 states. Not only do we want to expand testing services across the country, but we also want to keep broadening our healthcare offerings. Our mission is to provide high-quality, tailored healthcare to all regardless of age, gender, background, and insurance status. As part of our growth, eMBRY Health seeks to establish eMBRY Women's Health clinics, eMBRY Men's Health clinics, and eMBRY Aesthetics medical centers and day spas, in the states it will enter.  <br><br>eMBRY Health is a destination for top-tiered clinical talent.
