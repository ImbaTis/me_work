A common design language should track across all the functions, and we should look toward developing our own design voice.</p>\n<p style=\"min-height: 1.5em;\">Since we are a small team, our head of design will be a broad role, primarily focussed on web design for our marketing sites and UI design for our platforms.

So come show us what we're missing.</p>\n<p>We think these things are pretty obvious, but we're a bit grossed-out that no one else is really saying them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No one wants to be compelled to commute into an office anymore. That's why, while Buyapowa has offices around the world (and we love getting together face-to-face), we're fully committed to the virtual workspace, and we're delighted that our team gets to work wherever in the world they call home.</li>\n<li>No one's worked at Buyapowa until they work at Buyapowa. So, while we value experience, we know that the greatest experience you can have is the experience you'll gain once you start working with us.</li>\n<li>No one stops being talented just because they're in their 50s or 60s. We love fresh ideas, but we don't have a weird youth fetish like some other employers.</li>\n<li>That said, Mozart was composing classics when he was only five years old. So, if you're just starting out on your journey, that's amazing too.</li>\n<li>Apparently, the average person changes career 5-7 times over the course of their working life. Between you and us, we think that might be BS, but either way: we don't care if this is your first and only career or you're embarking on change number 5, 6 or 7. If you've got the talent, we want you.</li>\n<li>We actively celebrate all forms of diversity, and we'll love the way you look, the things you believe in, the life you live and the people you love.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, that's us. We love building the future and we love the people we're building the future with. If you're the future-building kind, and you've got the smarts to back it up, the job's already yours.</p>\n<p><strong>The role:</strong></p>\n<p>We are looking for a Content Producer Intern to join our team ASAP, you will have a focus on delivering visual content across all of our brand and marketing materials, but especially for social media, blogs and emails.</p>\n<p>This is a full time internship and we ask for a minimum commitment from you of 6 months.
