We specialize in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user experience research and design</li>\n<li>full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)</li>\n<li>data analytics</li>\n<li>email</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>about your role and team</strong></div>\n<p>If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!</p>\n<p>As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav \u2013 the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.</p>\n<p>Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time \u2013 both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, \u201cdo the bare minimum\u201d, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with \u201cthat's not in my job description\u201d attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.</p>\n<p>Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your \u201cweird\u201d show every once in awhile.</p>\n<p>We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply.

We have over eight million registered users from around the world and over 400,000 people use our platform each day. Our primary product is an online, real-time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</p>\n<p>Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of about fifty with fifteen developers. We were recently recognised as one of the<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-recognized-as-one-of-the-uks-top-100-fastest-growing-businesses\" rel=\"nofollow\"> UK's top 100 fastest growing businesses</a> and as the<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleaf-named-2020-saas-awards-winner\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Best SaaS for Nonprofits or Education</a> in the 2020 SaaS Awards Program.</p>\n<p>We're part of the <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.digital-science.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Science</a> family of science, health and ed-tech companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Your New Role</strong></p>\n<p>We are looking to hire a frontend engineer to help work on our platform. This is a complex web app that allows users to edit their scientific documents in collaboration with others, in real-time.</p>\n<p>Initially, your main focus for this will be helping us migrate from Angular 1 to React (a lot of which has been done already) and to switch our code editor from ACE to CodeMirror. In the longer term, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode to help non-LaTeX users, and more.</p>\n<p>There will be opportunities to work on the backend, so full-stack engineers, as well as frontend engineers, are welcome to apply.</p>\n<p>As a Software Engineer at Overleaf, you will be helping to make Overleaf the place where scientists, researchers and academics go to do their best work.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Tech</strong></p>\n<p>Overleaf is based on open-source software, and most of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub:<a class=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf</a></p>\n<p>On the front end, we mainly use React, although we are still migrating some code from Angular 1. On the backend, we run a microservices architecture, mainly in Node.js using MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Redis, running on Google Kubernetes Engine.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Work</strong></p>\n<p>Overleaf is remote-first \u2014 all staff work remotely and this is <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/about/values\" rel=\"nofollow\">part of our values</a>. We also have an office space in London for those that want to use it, and when the pandemic settles down we'll again get the whole team together in London a few times a year for face-to-face time.</p>\n<p>Our core hours for meetings are 2pm\u20135pm UK time; we try to schedule all team meetings during this time, including daily 10\u201315 minute standup calls and biweekly company update calls.</p>\n<p>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews. Our engineers work closely with the product team in product trios (PM, engineer, UX) during both discovery and delivery of new features.</p>\n<p>Our development process is based on the \u201cShape Up\u201d model, using 6-week delivery cycles and a 2-week cooldown between them. In each cycle, we have multiple delivery tracks, each with its own tech lead. Engineers move between delivery teams each cycle. We practice code review, invest in automated testing and are big fans of linting.</p>\n<p><strong>How We Hire</strong></p>\n<p>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within 7 working days from when we receive it.</li>\n<li>We'll follow up by email with any questions we have about your application, usually around logistics, your ambitions and your expectations about the role.</li>\n<li>We\u2019ll schedule a 30-minute call for an initial discussion to discuss the role and your experience, to see if they look like a good fit.</li>\n<li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is based on a short homework assignment (max 1h outside of interview) or an exercise during the interview if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists).</li>\n<li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>We require that you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a minimum of 2-3 years experience writing frontend code in JavaScript and CSS and HTML (we aren\u2019t taking on new graduates at the moment)\n<ul>\n<li>Experience with the technologies we use (like React) helps, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Will work for us full time (or nearly full time)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Are based in the UK, EU, US or Canada</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm\u20135pm UK time</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote and flexible working.</li>\n<li>Salary \u00a340k\u2013\u00a375k per year depending on experience.</li>\n<li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.</li>\n<li>We're substantially (around 80%) open-source, so your work will often be on open source code.</li>\n<li>We get everyone together in London for team meetings several times a year for valuable face-to-face time (pandemic permitting).</li>\n<li>We\u2019ll provide a new Mac, PC or Linux laptop, along with a stipend for other equipment.</li>\n<li>We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.</li>\n<li>We run regular <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/blog/overleafs-remote-hackathon-revisited-one-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">remote hackathons</a> to keep learning and experimenting.</li>\n<li>We run a weekly internal seminar series with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</li>\n<li><strong>Adopt a Growth Mindset:</strong> Solving problems that seem intractable is a big part of what we do. Maintain an attitude of possibility, persevere through challenges, and commit to personal growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Calm the Chaos:</strong> Complex problems require your prefrontal cortex to be engaged. Resist the temptation of an urgency-based culture by focusing on prevention instead of hot-fixes, prioritizing self-care, and developing a steady working rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose Candor:</strong> Healthy conflict in a psychologically-safe environment is a critical component of a high-functioning team. We hold each other accountable and strengthen our work by challenging ideas respectfully and directly. Speak up and share your point of view, even when it\u2019s hard.</li>\n<li><strong>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</strong> Effective communication is our cultural glue and it is everyone\u2019s job. Produce durable artifacts of your thinking and reject false dichotomies that present code and communication as separate things. No one is \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201cnon-technical\u201d; everyone is both.</li>\n<li><strong>Craft in Context:</strong> Domain understanding is critical and working in a vacuum leads to problems. Before you leap to conclusions, take the time to understand the problem and match your solution to the situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">We have a commitment outside of codebases as well. At Corgibytes, we\u2019re really good at transforming broken systems. We modernize code through continuous improvement and marginal gains, and we apply these same practices to systems of social oppression. Similar to how technical debt makes a codebase difficult to work with, there are institutional barriers for some individuals that have accumulated over time. Blindly operating within these structures hurts people and prevents organizations from benefiting from the wide range of perspectives needed to thrive. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity for improvement and we use our core values and our talents as menders to have a positive impact on our society.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Does this sound like you? Awesome! We live these values every day, and they\u2019re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They\u2019ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We\u2019re the type of company where it\u2019s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, inclusion, and trust.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px; padding: 0px; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;

We also provide personalised medical insights, information and recommendations. The platform is private-by-design. We feel strongly that people should be in full control of their sensitive health data and choose who can access it.</p>\n<p>Taking part in research is currently hard to do and a poor experience for the patient. Finding out about opportunities is haphazard, and there is often little meaningful return for those who take the time and care to get involved. The result is that organisations with cutting edge theories and medicines to test, can\u2019t find the right patients to work with. To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms.

In this way, researchers can reach many people who wouldn\u2019t be able to travel, globally, and run their studies much faster and at a lower cost.</p>\n<p>Today, the Sano platform is helping thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, we are expanding our product to be a 'patient portal' for national scale precision medicine initiatives such as Genomics England, with the goal of impacting millions of people.
