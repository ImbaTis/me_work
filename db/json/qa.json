Seeking a rewarding opportunity to positively impact the lives of others? Want to transform the image that our nation's healthcare system is \u201crestraining,\u201d \u201cantiquated,\u201d and \u201cburdensome\u201d? Look no further than eMBRY Health!  <br><br>In early 2020, Raymond Embry witnessed the need for a more effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of Arizonans fell ill daily. Communities across the state desperately sought testing services that local governments could not provide. Embry, a lifelong healthcare industry advocate, seized the moment. With fewer than ten employees, he created eMBRY Health to fill the testing void. <br><br>Over the last year, our company has experienced rapid growth due to the pressing need for COVID-19 testing services. Nearly 300,000 Arizonans have benefited from eMBRY Health's critical testing services, and we've wanted to offer such services nationwide. In just the last few weeks, eMBRY Health has expanded its national footprint and established testing sites in states such as Florida, Hawaii, Colorado, and Texas. Nearly 10,000 people get tested by visiting eMBRY Health testing sites daily in all markets.  <br><br>In the next year, eMBRY Health envisions being fully operational with COVID-19 testing services in all 50 states. Not only do we want to expand testing services across the country, but we also want to keep broadening our healthcare offerings. Our mission is to provide high-quality, tailored healthcare to all regardless of age, gender, background, and insurance status. As part of our growth, eMBRY Health seeks to establish eMBRY Women's Health clinics, eMBRY Men's Health clinics, and eMBRY Aesthetics medical centers and day spas, in the states it will enter.  <br><br>eMBRY Health is a destination for top-tiered clinical talent. It is also a nurse practitioner-centric organization founded by an NP. We are looking for strategic leaders with clinical and operational experience to be thought partners with expansion plans.</em><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><strong>Director of Quality</strong></div>\n<div class=\"h3\"><strong>Location: Remote\u00a0</strong></div>\n<div class=\"h3\"><em></em><strong>Position Purpose</strong></div>\n<p>The Director of Quality is a part of the Clinical Delivery Team who will be responsible for directing all quality management activities of the team.

Please note that this is not an automation role. We are hiring QA Analysts that have the ability to program in PHP and Javascript, and have a strong interest not just in finding bugs, but looking at code to determine why they exist, and occasionally dropping in a quick fix to continue testing.</p>\n<p>The salary range for this role is $90,000 to $120,000 with full benefits. It includes a no-strings-attached $15,000 dollar hiring bonus on your first paycheck. We are confident you\u2019ll love working at Defiant and being a part of our amazing team, and our signing bonus reflects that.</p>\n<p>At Defiant, we have broken down the traditional wall that exists between Dev and QA. Our QA team is more technical than most and spends time not just finding, reproducing, and logging bugs, but actually diagnosing the underlying cause and providing an unusual amount of detail to our dev team to help them quickly implement a fix.</p>\n<p>For this role, you need to be able to read and write PHP and Javascript code along with SQL. Our hiring process will include a technical portion that will evaluate your ability to not only find and report bugs but to determine what the underlying cause of a bug is.</p>\n<p>If you are currently in a QA role that is not as technical as you\u2019d like, and you want to get your hands dirty looking at PHP and JS code, tracing execution, diving into the database, and diagnosing the underlying cause of an issue, then this role may be perfect for you.</p>\n<p>Much like the DevOps role broke down the wall between the operations team and the development team, we have broken down the wall between QA and Dev by creating a role that we are calling \u201cQADev\u201d.</p>\n<p>This job is 100% remote. You can work from anywhere as long as you have bandwidth. We do most of our calls voice only, and we also use push-to-talk so you can operate in noisy environments like a coffee shop, while traveling, or with kids around.</p>\n<p>We are looking for individuals who don\u2019t just do the minimum. Our team tries harder, goes further, digs deeper, pushes technology beyond its customary boundaries. WordPress powers 40% of the web, and we are the leaders in WordPress security. Compromise or complacency is not an option for us.</p>\n<p>Our core hours are from 10am \u2013 1pm Pacific Time, Monday through Friday. In general, we want our team to be available during that time, but we\u2019re a realistic company, we understand that life happens, and we\u2019re outcome-focused. So as long as you\u2019re doing a great job and getting things done, we are flexible.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>At Defiant we have one core value, and that is \u201cTrust\u201d. We trust that you\u2019ll do a great job working remotely, be available during our core hours, and once you run out of work, find other ways to contribute. We don\u2019t micro-manage and we don\u2019t continuously monitor our team or their productivity. If you love QA, are passionate about your job, are productive, and can help the team ship great software, you\u2019ll be very successful at Defiant.</p>\n<p>The specific skills we require for this position are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience testing complex web applications is required.</li>\n<li>Experience testing LAMP applications is preferred.</li>\n<li>Mid-level PHP programming ability and use of dev tools required.</li>\n<li>Mid-level Javascript programming ability and use of dev tools is required.</li>\n<li>Experience working with a bug tracking system like Fogbugz, JIRA, or similar is required.</li>\n<li>SQL knowledge is required.</li>\n<li>AWS experience is preferred.</li>\n<li>A passion for testing applications and shipping robust software is a must. This is a quality assurance role, not a developer role.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hiring Process</strong></p>\n<p>All positions require a trial period of approximately 3 weeks with a minimum commitment of 10 hours per week. You will be paid for this short-term contract, and it will be used to evaluate whether both parties want to pursue an ongoing, regular employment relationship.</p>\n<p>All offers of employment are contingent on the successful completion of a background check.
