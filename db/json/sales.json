Aeroseal Duct Sealing is a patented breakthrough technology for the HVAC market that tackles ductwork leaks from the inside out. The Aeroseal process puts escaping air under pressure and causes polymer particles to stick first to the edges of a leak, then to each other until the leak is closed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;\">The Aeroseal process won the \"Best of What's New\" award from Popular Science magazine, and the \"Energy 100\" award from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The DOE also rated the Aeroseal duct sealing process as one of the 23 most beneficial technologies available to American consumers that has come out since the agency was created.</span></p>\n"}, {"id": 990178, "url": "https://remotive.io/remote-jobs/sales/junior-business-development-manager-benelux-990178", "title": "Junior Business Development Manager, Benelux", "company_name": "MARPRO", "category": "Sales", "tags": [], "job_type": "full_time", "publication_date": "2021-11-23T05:40:23", "candidate_required_location": "Europe Only", "salary": "", "description": "<p><strong>Do you have experience with sales in the maritime industry?

In short, make customers your #1 priority through user research.\u00a0\u00a0</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div>That\u2019s why we exist.
