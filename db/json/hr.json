Behind the platform, we\u2019re real people who celebrate diversity, individuality, and inclusion every day. We adopt a communicative digital culture that thrives on transparency, inquisitive learning, gifs, and emojis.</p>\n<p>Our core values underpin how we work together day-to-day and the support we give to our customers and team members. We strive to empower our team members to be self-directed and self-motivated in their roles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Think critically:</strong> We're reflective and open to challenge. As critical thinkers, we can use data to comprehensively explore issues, ideas, and events with a customer-centric approach before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. If our perspectives and assumptions are mistaken or incomplete, we acknowledge it and are willing to change what we are doing or what we believe in the light of these critical insights.</li>\n<li><strong>Learn continuously.</strong> We're crazy about self-development and take every opportunity we can to learn. Every failure, victory, difficult conversation, and instance of feedback are a chance to learn and improve daily. When we fail, we take ownership of our mistakes, reflect on them and learn. When we succeed, we ensure we celebrate this and share our achievements with others.</li>\n<li><strong>Assert and empathize:</strong> We're candid in expressing our wants and needs while still considering the rights, demands, and wants of others. We make an effort to make ourselves understood by engaging in proactive communication. We ask questions when we are uncertain, speak up when having an opinion or idea, ask for help when we need it, question the status quo, and speak up when we feel reserved, embarrassed, or fear being wrong or upsetting people. If a conflict should arise, we are patient and receptive to other peoples' viewpoints. We are committed to helping others achieve success.</li>\n<li><strong>Innovate and adapt:</strong> We move forward with an adaptive mindset, and we're not afraid to do things differently or change the way we do things. We thrive in environments of constant change and see opportunities where others see risk. Our mindset doesn\u2019t depend on scale or resources; instead, we draw on our creativity and scrappiness for varied solutions and optimization of opportunities.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust</strong>: We define trust as the belief and confidence in our people and organization's integrity, reliability, and fairness. We bring the best of who we are to our work, and we take ownership in collaborating, cooperating, and contributing to achieve our mission and ensure our customers have all the support they need to reach their creative goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistently deliver memorable experiences:</strong> We are committed to excellence and dedicated to raising the bar in making every user experience exceptionally memorable. Our customers should leave happy even if they don't buy from us. Clients and buyers should refer others to us, even if we didn't fulfill their projects. Talents should be excited, even if they don't pass our application process. Candidates for our job openings should love us and tell all their friends about us even if we don't hire them. Team members should love Bunny Studio - its people, processes, technology stack, payroll, culture, and more - even after leaving our team. We should be fanatical about delivering remarkable experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a look <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://bunnystudio.com/blog/bunny-studio-behind-the-scenes/?utm_source=workable&amp;utm_campaign=jobdescription\" rel=\"nofollow\">behind the scenes of how we work. </a>For more information on how we collaborate worldwide, check out our blog <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://bunnystudio.com/blog/we-are-bunny-studio/how-to-work-remotely/?utm_source=workable&amp;utm_campaign=jobdescription\" rel=\"nofollow\">We Are Bunny Studio</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout the whole organization, we aim to provide a multicultural experience and equal opportunities.

We also provide personalised medical insights, information and recommendations. The platform is private-by-design. We feel strongly that people should be in full control of their sensitive health data and choose who can access it.</p>\n<p>Taking part in research is currently hard to do and a poor experience for the patient. Finding out about opportunities is haphazard, and there is often little meaningful return for those who take the time and care to get involved. The result is that organisations with cutting edge theories and medicines to test, can\u2019t find the right patients to work with. To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms. We founded Sano to enable medical research that is data-driven and puts patients at the centre of the experience.</p>\n<p>Our current focus is on neurological and immune conditions (Parkinson\u2019s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Long COVID amongst others).</p>\n<p>A vital part of our offer is free at-home DNA testing. Each patient can then share their genetic data with the studies they wish to contribute to just through a few clicks. In this way, researchers can reach many people who wouldn\u2019t be able to travel, globally, and run their studies much faster and at a lower cost.</p>\n<p>Today, the Sano platform is helping thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, we are expanding our product to be a 'patient portal' for national scale precision medicine initiatives such as Genomics England, with the goal of impacting millions of people.
